# pyboot-g2s3

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks used in the [Gene Golub SIAM Summer School on High-Performance Data Analytics (2019)](https://project.inria.fr/siamsummerschool/) Python bootcamp.

> A good starting point is [`index.ipynb`](./index.ipynb). You'll find some exercises in [`supplemental`](./supplemental). The quick "live preview" demo we did in the first few minutes of the bootcamp may be found in [`dummy-live-demo-0.ipynb`](./dummy-live-demo-0.ipynb).

These materials were adapted from [Jake Vanderplas's "Whirlwind Tour of Python"](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/) and [Georgia Tech's CSE 6040: Computing for Data Analysis](https://cse6040.gatech.edu).
